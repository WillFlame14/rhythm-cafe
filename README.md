# rhythm-cafe

This is the webapp for https://rhythm.cafe

The overall approach is the "scrape everything and chuck it into a database" approach
used similarly to [chorus](https://github.com/paturages/chorus), which is the primary
inspiration. The scraper lives seperately in [rd-indexer](https://github.com/auburnsummer/rd-indexer);
this repo is just the frontend.
