# getting started

## option 1: gitpod

with gitpod you can get a hosted environment in 1 click! i'm just trying it out for now. it seems a little unpolished but the idea is really cool

(well actually it's like 5 clicks but whatever)

click: 

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/auburnsummer/rdlevels2)

## option 2: manual

pull this repo, `npm install`, then `npm start`.

to build the html: `npm run build`
