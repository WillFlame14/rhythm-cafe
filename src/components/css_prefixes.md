To organise the CSS, each component has a unique two letter prefix that each
of its classes begins with.

Each of these are notated in this list, so that I don't accidentally use the
same prefix for a component. This also acts as documentation for custom CSS
writers (I want to add the ability to add custom stylesheets at some point.)

 - `ConjunctionList`: `cl`
 - `DifficultyDecorator`: `dd`
 - `FacetSelect`: `fs`
 - `Header`: `he`
 - `LevelBox`: `lb`
 - `Levels`: `le`
 - `Preferences`: `pr`
 - `SearchBar`: `se`
 - `Sidebar`: `sb`
 - `SlidySelect`: `ss`
